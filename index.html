<h3>My name is Oliver, I go to Mira Loma High School and I don't have a plan, but I want people to think I do.</h3>
<h1><strong>Herring's History</strong></h1>
<p style="color: blue;">My name is <em>Oliver Herring</em>, I am 16 years old and I go to <em>Mira Loma Highschool</em>, I was born in <em>Sacramento California</em>, and I haven't left California before.<br>
<br>
I don't have that much to say about myself so I'm just gonna write random stuff.<br>
<br>
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p> 
<h1><strong>The 2020 Dumpster-fire and Corona Virus</strong></h1>
<p style="color: green;"><em>COVID-19</em> definitely changed who I am as a person, half of middle school was spent online and half of it was in person which gave me alot of time think, but also was really really boring. As you'd expect having to stay inside for the better part of a year can get old, so I didn't really have much to do, and I didn't socialize much except for online. I think COVID changed everyone's lives in some way, but this is how it changed mine.</p>
<h1><strong>and year after 2025</strong></h1>
<p style="color: red;">There's not a specific event I want to happen in 2025, but I do hope I can make a solid plan for myself, figure out a career and what I want to do with the rest of my life, and have a good backup plan incase whatever that is doesn't work out.</p>
